# DNS-Latency-Tester
This script tests the latency of public DNS servers in your country and provides the fastest IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It retrieves your public IP address, determines your country code, fetches a list of public DNS servers for your country, and performs a ping test on each server to measure the latency.
